## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)** is a Lorentz-invariant, coherence-based field model in which:

- **Mass** arises as saturated regions of structured wave-phase coherence,
- **Inertia** results from drag at phase boundaries in the substrate,
- **Gravity** emerges as a long-range tension gradient seeking coherence equilibrium.

This framework reinterprets spacetime curvature, gravitational attraction, and inertial behavior as **emergent physical phenomena** arising from a conserved, relativistic quantum fluid substrate. It offers an integrated explanation for mass, time, motion, and field behavior â€” with clear connections to General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory under appropriate limits.
